<img style="max-width:100%;" alt="Conspiracy Wall" src="https://raw.github.com/C3/weekly-challenge/master/004-submarines/assets/conspiracy-wall.jpg"/>

This week's challenge is all about the Internet, and maps... and maps of the Internet. The Internet! It's a Global Conspiracyâ„¢ !!!

Now, thanks to the fine folks at TG releasing [the 2013 Submarine Cable Map](http://blog.telegeography.com/post/42364809478), we have the perfect addition to our conspiracy wall. Everyone has a conspiracy wall, right? This map provides a classic-looking backdrop for all those frenetically drawn red circles denoting known <abbr title="[Inter]National Security Agency">NSA</abbr> <abbr title="Man In The Middle">MITM</abbr> <abbr title="Point Of Presence">POP</abbr>s, tenuous links to accidents at sea, kraken sightings and the like.

The Challenge
-------------

The highest-resolution "complete image", publically available, measures 3000x2160. That's not large enough for us.

The [Interactive Submarine Cable Map](http://submarine-cable-map-2013.telegeography.com/)
makes use of high-resolution tiles. At the most detailed zoom level, the image looks to be a far superior quality.

- 10 points: Determine the dimensions of the highest-res map image that can be reassembed using tiles
- 40 points: Write a script for recovering the tiles and reassembling the complete map image
- Bonus: Compile a referenced list of known "five-eyes" submarine cable intercept points
