Weekly Challenge
================

Hey folks. This is the weekly challenge repo.

The idea is weekly challenges are posted and if you're struggling to figure out
what to do in 10% time or during your weekend then you can give these a shot.
They should be fun and serve to sharpen your code-fu.

I'll try to post interesting challenges here on a weekly basis. On Monday
morning participants get to chill and discuss the solutions for a while.

I'll let y'all know when there's a new one posted.

Cheers,
Pete.
