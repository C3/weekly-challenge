XOR Pad
=======

Two files were found in a rogue-account on one of our systems.  
The first is a ruby script that does some basic encryption,  
the second looks to be the encrypted message.

Mmm, looks to be the key is missing...  
though forensic evidence suggests it was 6 bytes long.

- 10 points: find the first byte of the key
- 20 points: decrypt the whole message
- 50 points: find the referenced info :D
