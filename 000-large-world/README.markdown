Large World
===========

So there's this [excellent XKCD comic](http://www.xkcd.com/1110/) that includes
a very large tiled world. The challenge, should you choose to enjoy it, is to
craft a program in your language of choice to assemble the entire world into
one giant image.

To get started, make a folder in this directory, name it after you. Then you
get to use git and none of your commits will conflict with anyone elses.
Make a branch named after you and get your hack on.

When you're done, checkout master and do a `git merge --no-ff your-branch` then push.
Include the finished image if you manage to get it!

It's a large world, but not too large to be tamed by teh codez.
